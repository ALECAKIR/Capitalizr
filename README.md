# Capitalizr 🅰️↔️🅰️

Capitalizr is a streamlined, user-friendly Visual Studio Code extension designed specifically to toggle the first letter case (uppercase to lowercase, or vice versa) of filenames and folder names with ease. It integrates seamlessly into your workflow by providing both Command Palette and Explorer context menu options, enhancing productivity and maintaining consistent naming conventions effortlessly.

## ✨ Features

- **Single-click Toggle:** Easily switch the first letter case of any file or folder directly from the VS Code Explorer context menu.
- **Active File Toggle:** Quickly toggle the case of the active file's name from the Command Palette, optimizing your workflow.
- **Automatic Handling of Unsaved Files:** If the active file hasn't been saved yet (e.g., "Untitled-1"), Capitalizr automatically prompts you to save the file before proceeding, ensuring no data loss.
